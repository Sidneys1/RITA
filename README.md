# RITA
RITA Is Totally an Acronym

---

RITA is a Java Terminal, with commands such as `ls`, `cat`, and `cd`. Its structure is multi-threaded, with piping support.
Commands are loaded at runtime from Commands.jar, and are each searched for compatible piping in/out formats, aliases, and help documentation.
This was written as a continuous homework project for a CS "OOP/Java" class.
