How to Compile:

Export all items under Commands project (including Commands.Helpers) to a Jar titled "Commands.jar". Export all items under RITA project into RITA.jar and select RITA as the launch method. Launch RITA.jar from the same directory as Commands.jar.

To Debug:
	Place Commands.jar in the RITA project directory. (I should already have on there)
